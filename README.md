# This is the version 2 of the project.

A simple React js ecom project.


Please visit [https://myecomx.netlify.app/](https://myecomx.netlify.app/) to view it in your browser.

Please checkout the version 1 from my repo list if you're interested in seeing that - it uses the basics of react such as routing, observers and context.

This version 2 however, will cover a lot of topics and include 3rd party library such as stripe payment gateway.

# How to run

Simply clone the project, run npm install and you're good to go.
The project does use Google's firebase and firestore tools, which means you'd have to copy your own keys and use. 

Please check the #utils folder for any 3rd party tools and use your own keys and pharase...
